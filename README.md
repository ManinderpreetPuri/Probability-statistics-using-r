# Probability-statistics-using-r
These are projects I did in university during probability and statistics on R studio. I scored 91% in the subject. The projects involve finding probabilities of events, support and confidence of bayes rules. Performed statistical analysis on Groceries data set to find association rules. Also used probability density function, integrate function,  joint probability mass function, poisson distribution, probability mass function, binomial distribution,  M|M|1 queue and hypothesis testing in R studio. I also wrote an essay summarizing an article written by a statistician (Jim Ridgway) for someone who is not familiar with statistical terms.
